## Who we share your data with
Your data is currently shared only with Google in our use of the Google Analytics piece of software. The only piece of data shared is your user ID, which we use to ensure that our website is easy to use and to continuously improve our service. There would be no way that anyone at Google could reasonably identify you based solely on this piece of information, as your user ID is not displayed on this website.
